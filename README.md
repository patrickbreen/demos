This repo holds three selected projects to demonstrate some of my non-production work for demonstration purposes. Of the three projects, the first (6502 emulator) is the largest, most complete, best tested, and a relatively recent demonstration of my work.

1. `emulator_6502` - a MOS Technology 6502 emulator written in rust.

2. `pong_reinforcement_learning` - a simple pong game that learns to play pong using reinforcement learning.

3. `servers` - A threaded HTTP server written in rust.

4. `asm6502` - A 6502 assembler written in rust.
