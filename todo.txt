Things that I eventually want to build as I learn rust:

1 Handmade Servers - HTTP, FTP, tFTP, SSH, netcat
2 6502 emulator, assembler, c compiler

3 ML - Pong RL (voice, NLP, CV)

- Gameboy emulator
- Embedded - quadcopter raspberry pi, general embedded demo/ embedded sensors demo

- very simple kernel like in little OS book
5 userspace network card PCI driver
- ext2 file system - written in C or rust

- blockchain - monero + nanocoin + ethereum + builtin exchanges/exchange rate / inflation rate
- blockchain example in rust demo
- SDR demo
4 embedded KV DB in rust

- verilog model of 6502
