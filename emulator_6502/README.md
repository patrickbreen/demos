## Build and Run

Step one: get `cargo` installed on your machine.

Build and run tests: `cargo test`

Run a snake game, written in binary (by someone else), assembled into a ROM using my assembler, running on my emulator (with some other virtual hardware I made): `cargo run snake`

Run example (trivial) binary that only uses the emulator (no other virtual hardware): `cargo run infinite_loop.bin`
